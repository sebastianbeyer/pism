//! Manages iterating over element indices.
/*! When computing residuals and Jacobians, there is a loop over all the elements in the
  IceGrid, and computations are done on each element. The IceGrid has an underlying PETSc
  DM, and a process typically does not own all of the nodes in the grid. Therefore we
  should perform a computation on a subset of the elements. In general, an element will
  have ghost (o) and real (*) vertices:

  \verbatim
  o---*---*---*---o
  |   |   |   |   |
  o---*---*---*---o
  |   |   |   |   |
  o---o---o---o---o
  \endverbatim

  The strategy is to perform computations on this process on every element that has
  a vertex that is owned by this processor.  But we only update entries in the
  global residual and Jacobian matrices if the corresponding row corresponds to a
  vertex that we own.  In the worst case, where each vertex of an element is owned by
  a different processor, the computations for that element will be repeated four times,
  once for each processor.

  This same strategy also correctly deals with periodic boundary conditions. The way PETSc
  deals with periodic boundaries can be thought of as using a kind of ghost. So the rule
  still works: compute on all elements containg a real vertex, but only update rows
  corresponding to that real vertex.

  The calculation of what elements to index over needs to account for ghosts and the
  presence or absense of periodic boundary conditions in the IceGrid. The ElementIterator
  performs that computation for you (see ElementIterator::xs and friends).
