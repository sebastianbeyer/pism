/**
   Identify node types of all the nodes (grid points).

   Uses width=1 ghosts of `ice_thickness` (a "box" stencil).

   A node is can be *interior*, *boundary*, or *exterior*.

   An element is considered *icy* if all four of its nodes have ice thickness above
   `thickness_threshold`.

   A node is considered *interior* if all of the elements it belongs to are icy.

   A node is considered *boundary* if it is not interior and at least one element it belongs to is
   icy.

   A node is considered *exterior* if it is neither interior nor boundary.

   Now an element "face" (side) is a part of a boundary if and only if both of its nodes are
   boundary nodes.
