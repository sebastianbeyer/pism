* Things I need to do
1. [X] Split allocation and setup from re-setting input fields.
2. [X] Add a 3D DMDA (with dof==1) and the associated Vec to store ice hardness.
3. [X] Write the restriction hook.
4. [X] Write the interpolation code (to and from the PISM grid).
5. [X] Replace "bed" with "ice lower surface elevation"
6. [ ] Document the whole thing.
7. [X] Make the code match PISM's notation for grid and physical dimensions (Mx, Lx, etc)
8. [ ] Think about stress boundary conditions (shelves and grounded margins).
9. [X] Make sure that the the units are set correctly (i.e. scaling).
10. [ ] Allow prescribing Dirichlet boundary conditions other than no-slip at the base.
11. [ ] Disable no-slip conditions at the base.
12. [ ] Think about grid sequencing to compute the initial guess.
13. [ ] Use GeometryCalculator to determine if "floating" or "grounded"
14. [X] Think about fields that we will need to save to restart the model.
15. [X] Implement the computation of the surface gradient using gridded data.
16. [ ] Determine if the Jacobian really is symmetric in our (more general) case.
17. [ ] Write the code checking if grid dimensions are compatible with
    the chosen number of coarsenings. (This is to avoid ugly PETSC
    ERROR tracebacks.)
18. [X] Consider switching element types at the margin. Yes, there are lots of cases.
19. [X] Switch to using PISM's basal drag computation.
20. [X] Switch to computing the effective viscosity using =IceFlowLaw=.
21. [X] Make =BlatterStressBalance= a derived class of
    =ShallowStressBalance= to re-use diagnostics, the vertical
    velocity computation, and the basal frictional heating computation
    code.


* Inputs
- ice thickness
- ice bottom surface topography
- basal yield stress
- sea level elevation
- ice enthalpy on the `PISM` grid (used to compute the ice hardness on the "sigma" grid)


* Outputs
- $u$ and $v$ components of the horizontal velocity on the `PISM` grid
- $u$ and $v$ on the sigma grid for restarting
- vertically averaged horizontal velocity (for mass continuity time-stepping)
- strain heating $\Sigma$.
